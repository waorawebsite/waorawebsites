    <p> Welcome to the Kawakawa Market Website, this is a website to help you find <br> and decide what you would like buy and some background history around it. <br>
        The Kawakawa Market is to help kids that go to the school to learn how to run <br> and work in a bussiness, as you can see we have a lot of "micro" or mini bussiness's. <br>
        There are lots of bennifits for working in a mini bussiness while you are young,<br> to get a headstart in education for the outside world when you are older.
